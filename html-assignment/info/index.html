        <p>Hi! My name is Tahira. I will tell you about my most unforgetable experience of my life.One of the most unforgettable experiences was from my childhood when I went swimming for the first time in 2011 with my mom, my brothers, and my uncleâ€™s family.  We were visiting my grandmother's house, where we used to spend every summer during our school break. My uncle was an Air Force officer and the captain of the sailing team so being involved in sea sports was a big part of his life. He often took his children along, making sure they learn and participated. That summer, he decided to take all of us for swimming, something I had always wanted to do but never had the chance to.</p>
