                <p>
                    My name is Tahira.I'm someone who loves the idea of travelling and hopes to explore the world one day. I enjoy activities that trigger my dopamine and bring excitement,even though I haven't tried them yet but I would love to. I love cats. 
                </p>
                <p>One of the places I aspire to visit is Switzerland, renowned for its breathtaking landscapes and abundant natural beauty. Skydiving is one of my most ambitiuos goals. A weird fun fact about me is that my pinkey finger has four distinct phalange creases, which often intrigue others and I get to flex it since my childhood. </p>
